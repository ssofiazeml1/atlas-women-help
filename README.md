# Atlas — Safe Anonymous Crisis Resources Platform

Production-ready, calm, mobile-first website that helps refugee and immigrant women access support without risk of exposure.

**Safety and privacy above everything.**

## Core Features (all included and functional)

- **Interactive Help Map** — Global Leaflet + OSM map. Filters by aid type (shelter, legal, psychological, crisis, medical).  Real starter locations included (multiple languages). Users can suggest new anonymous locations (moderated).
- **Anonymous Chatbot** — Worst-case scenario private guidance with decision-tree flows. 4 languages (EN / RU / FR / AR). Always prominent hotline escalation info. Everything client-side. Nothing sent or saved server-side.
- **Checklists** — Two complete printable/exportable checklists for (1) helpers and (2) victims. Persistent only as long as the tab is open.
- **Case Stories** — Moderated and published anonymous stories with situation → actions → outcome sections. Multilingual. Users can submit their stories anonymously.
- **Multilingual** — Full first-class English, Russian, French, Arabic with fast in-page language switching. Automatic RTL flip for Arabic. All content and UI translated.
- **Safety UI** — Always available prominent "Leave this site quickly" button. Clears local storage. Opens neutral page in new tab + replaces the current page in history. Disguised view toggle offered in footer (title + appearance only).

## Technical Stack (as recommended and delivered)

- Vite + React + TypeScript + Tailwind
- i18next (browser detector), react-router
- Leaflet / react-leaflet for map (OpenStreetMap tiles)
- Supabase JS client pre-wired (use demo mode or connect your hosted Postgres + RLS tables for real persistence)
- No analytics. No tracking. No cookies for public visitors.
- CSP headers via vercel.json

## Admin (demo + production)

Admin protected area `/admin`:
- Login with demo password (printed in app and runbook).
- Manage live locations (CRUD + map point picker).
- Review anonymous suggestion queue + pending stories.
- Changes in demo persist through localStorage.

**For real deployment**:
- Replace demo auth with actual Supabase Authentication (single trusted admin user account).
- Create DB tables (locations, cases, location_suggestions, case_submissions) with Row Level Security policies that allow only admin writes.
- Replace in-memory local hooks with realtime Supabase client.

Full schema is documented in the plan and runbook below.

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Visit http://localhost:5173

Use the **"Leave this site quickly"** button at any moment. It is unobtrusive yet always reachable.

Admin demo: go to `/admin` , enter the password `demo-admin-2024` (clearly printed on screen too).

## Production Deployment

### Automatic Vercel deployment

Pushes to `codex/vercel-deploy` are deployed by
`.github/workflows/deploy-vercel.yml`. Configure these GitHub Actions repository
secrets before running the workflow:

- `VERCEL_TOKEN`
- `VERCEL_ORG_ID`
- `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID`
- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
- `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- `VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
- `VITE_OWNER_EMAIL`

The Supabase anon and publishable variables may contain the same public client
key while both client integrations remain in the application. Never put a
Supabase secret or service-role key in a `VITE_*` variable.

For a manual deployment, run `vercel --prod` from the repository root.

- Pre-create your one trusted admin user in Supabase dashboard and set your RLS policies.
- Deploy `supabase/functions/verify-admin-password` separately and store
  `ATLAS_ADMIN_PASSWORD` as a Supabase Edge Function secret.

Starting data:
- Map seeds are in code + moved into local/session storage on first load.
- Stories are in-page static for this demo.
- Scores of ready to migrate station locations + case narratives.

## Privacy & Safety Notes

- The quick exit button is resistant to simple history back navigation.
- No personal data, geolocation or cookies collected on the public-facing site.
- All chatbot conversations and checklist progress delete on page close.
- Admin panel has no password recovery UI to limit exposure.

See `IMPLEMENTATION_AND_RUNBOOK.md` and the implementation plan for details.
